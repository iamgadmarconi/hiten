Poincare Maps Module
====================

The Poincare module provides a comprehensive framework for computing and analyzing Poincare maps in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). It includes specialized implementations for center manifold maps, synodic maps, and single-hit detection, along with core infrastructure for numerical integration and section crossing detection.

The module is organized into several submodules:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   centermanifold
   core
   singlehit
   synodic
   utils

.. currentmodule:: hiten.algorithms.poincare
