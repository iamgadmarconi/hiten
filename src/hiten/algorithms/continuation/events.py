"""Event definitions for continuation algorithms (placeholder).

This module is reserved for future event-related utilities used by
continuation algorithms, such as stopping conditions based on event
zero-crossings or custom user callbacks. It currently contains no
public API.

Notes
-----
All functionality in this module is planned for future releases. When
implemented, events will provide a structured way to define and handle
continuation-specific conditions without coupling them to core engine
logic.
