"""Event definitions for continuation algorithms (placeholder).

This module is reserved for future event definitions used to control or
monitor continuation runs (e.g., stop conditions, logging hooks, and
callbacks). It provides a central place to define reusable events that can
be referenced by continuation engines and strategies.
